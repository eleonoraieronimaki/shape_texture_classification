# Shape and Texture features for Classification

### Description 
In this repository, we are analysing the shape and texture features of embryos of a mutant of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana in order to assess a combination of them that performs well in a classification.
In the set of images provided, there are about three classes that express the mutant form differently which can be expressed by their size and shape. In order to classify the embryos as accurately as possible, various image processing and clustering techniques have been tested.
